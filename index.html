            <p>
              I am currently studying at Northcoders to become a full stack web
              developer. A few of the topics we have covered are NODE.js,
              building an API and using SQL to create databases. I have studied
              CSS, Bootstrap, HTML and some JavaScript separately. I left my job
              at Freshfields to pursue a career change to because a developer.
              Previously I was an Administration and Systems Manager at Colony
              Coworking in Manchester City Centre. Colony is an innovative and
              friendly coworking space for freelancers and digital nomads. In my
              role, I configured and streamlined processes on their CRM software
              Essensys Operate, improved their processes for workload management
              for internal employees, managed monthly invoices and bank
              reconciliation as well as chased late payments.
              <br />I have a PGcert in Real Estate and Property Management, as
              well as a background in illustration and graphics.
